    I started this project to learn the concepts of <mark> Data Warehousing </mark> using AWS Redshift to basically support the projects at my work.
    I enjoyed the Capstone project from <mark> Udacity </mark> where all the concepts from ETL are thoroughly discussed and were implemented in this
    project using the Data Orchestration tool <mark> Apache Airflow </mark>.

    I have also learnt data processing using <mark> PySpark Livy API </mark> in this project
