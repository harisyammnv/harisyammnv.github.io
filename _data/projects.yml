    I started this project to learn the concepts of <mark> Data Warehousing </mark> using AWS Redshift to basically support the projects at my work.
    I enjoyed the Capstone project from <mark> Udacity </mark> where all the concepts from ETL are thoroughly discussed and were implemented in this
    project using the Data Orchestration tool <mark> Apache Airflow </mark>.

    I have also learnt data processing using <mark> PySpark Livy API </mark> in this project

    - I have participated in the Udacity's PyTorch Scholarship Challenge along with my team member -> [Florin](https://github.com/masterflorin)
    - We had learnt the nuts and bolts of image classification and also worked on different steps of fine tuning our model
    - We have written a co-authored article in [medium](https://medium.com/udacity-pytorch-challengers/ideas-on-how-to-fine-tune-a-pre-trained-model-in-pytorch-184c47185a20)

    - I have done my Master thesis @ DAIMLER AG in Stuttgart
    - I have mostly worked on developing Robust Machine Learning algorithms which would deal with the Noise and Skewness in very large datasets
    - I have used denoising autoencoders to basically filter out the noise and then used a FNN with single noise layer to eliminate tagert skewness
