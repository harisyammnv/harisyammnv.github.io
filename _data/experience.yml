   Customer Project: Development of a scalable analytics pipeline for classifying vehicles with risk of catalyst failure 
   Customer: FORD Motors, US
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - Analyzed **Timeseries** sensor data collected from **10K** vehicles located in North America which was sent by the customer in batches
    - Optimized and pre-processed the raw data using **Dask** and created partitioned parquet files (**Prefect** Data pipeline)
    - Performed **aggregations** on the data at scale
    - Calculated custom KPIs using domain knowledge from Engineering
    - Built and Trained **XGBoost** model for risk classification
    - Observed model robustness through **feature engineering** and analyzed performance using metrics such as Precision, Recall
    - Tuned the model using **skopt** bayesian hyperparameter search
    - Wrapped the model using **FastAPI** REST endpoints for inference
    - Deployed the optimized model in an **AWS Lambda** function for active inference and feedback
    - Developed **Tableau** Dashboards for displaying the results and KPIs to key stakeholders
